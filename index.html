        As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
        Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. 
        Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.</p>

        <div class="homeCol" style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">
       <p style="margin-top: 5px;">  Bryant primarily played as a shooting guard. He was listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg),
        though Bryant himself said that he was 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m), or "probably" 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) in shoes. 
        He was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA.Bryant has drawn frequent comparisons to Jordan, 
        after whom he modeled his playing style.Like Jordan, he became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot.
        Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated described another of Bryant's most famous moves as the "jab step-and-pause": 
        Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax, but instead of bringing the jab foot back, he pushed off of 
        it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket.</p><br>

        <p>Bryant established a reputation for taking shots in the closing moments of tight games, even when he was double or triple-teamed,
        and was noted as one of the premier closers in the NBA. In a 2012 annual survey of NBA general managers, 
        Bryant was selected for the 10th consecutive season as the player general managers would want to take a clutch shot with a game on
        the line. Bryant enjoyed being the villain, and reveled in being booed and then silencing the crowd with his play.
        His ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection.Throughout his career, Bryant was disparaged 
        for being a selfish, high-volume shooter; he missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in
        NBA history.Phil Jackson, who coached Bryant for many years, stated that Bryant "tends to force the action, especially 
        when the game isn't going his way. When his shot is off, Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns."
        According to Bryant, "I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means you beat yourself, you psyched yourself out of the game."</p><br>

        <p>In addition to his abilities on offense, Bryant also established himself as a standout defensive player.
        Bryant rarely drew charges when he played defense, which he believed spared his body and contributed to his longevity.
        Some critics have suggested that Bryant's defensive accolades in his later years were based more on his reputation than his 
        actual play.</p><br>

        <p>Bryant was also lauded for his work ethic. Throughout his first 16 seasons, his body was resilient, and he exhibited a high
        pain threshold while often playing through injuries. A fierce competitor, Bryant made opponents and teammates alike the
        objects of his scorn. Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment
        and performance. According to sportswriter Mark Heisler of Forbes, "circa 2004–2007, Kobe was the most alienated
        superstar the NBA had ever seen." He did, however, lead the Lakers to two championships after the departure of 
        Shaquille O'Neal; during this period, he became more of a mentor to his teammates than he had been earlier in his career.
        Bryant's longtime head coach Phil Jackson noted that the biggest difference between his first and second stints
        in coaching the Lakers was if Bryant talked to teammates in his earlier years with the Lakers, it was usually, 
        "Give me the damn ball." During the latter period, "[Bryant] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them up when 
        we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. It was as if the other players were now his partners, not his personal 
        spear-carriers."</p><br>

            <p>Bryant was called "one of the greatest players in the history of our game" by NBA commissioner Adam Silver,and The New York Times wrote
            that he had "one of the most decorated careers in the history of the sport."Reuters called him "arguably the best player of his generation",
            while both Sporting News and TNT named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s. In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked him 
            the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan. Players including Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade,
            and Derrick Rose called Bryant their generation's version of Jordan. The Press-Enterprise described Bryant as 
            "maybe the greatest Laker in the organization's history". He was the Lakers' all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are
            tied for the most in franchise history. Both numbers he wore during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on
            December 18, 2017.</p><br>
            
            <p>With career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game, he was considered one of the most 
            complete players in NBA history. He was the first player in NBA history to have at least 30,000 career points and 
            6,000 career assists, and was one of only four players with 25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 6,000 assists.
            Bryant led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. His 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the
            second-highest in NBA history, behind only Chamberlain's 100. He scored at least 50 points 24 times in his career, 
            which is third in league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118); six times Bryant scored at least 60.
            He was just the third player in NBA history to average 40 points in a calendar month, which he accomplished four times. 
            Bryant was voted the league MVP in 2008 and led his team to the 2008 NBA Finals as the first seed in the Western Conference.
            In the 2008 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. men's basketball team, occasionally referred to as
            "The Redeem Team". He won another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He led the Lakers to two more championships in 2009 and 2010, winning the Finals MVP award on both occasions.</p><br>
            
            <p>Bryant was an 18-time All-Star, which ranks second behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 19. He was chosen a record 18 straight 
            times, each time as a starter. On four occasions (2003, 2011, 2013, 2016) he was the leading vote-getter.
            Four times Bryant was named the All-Star MVP, a record he shares with Bob Pettit. He was selected to the All-NBA Team
            on 15 occasions, tied for the most with Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan, and his 11 first-team honors are tied for the second-most with Karl Malone.
            Bryant was also a 12-time All-Defensive Team selection, trailing only Duncan's 15, and nine times he was named to the All-Defensive First Team, 
            tied with Jordan, Garnett, and Gary Payton for the most all time. He was the first guard to play 20 seasons in the NBA.
            He also won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 1997 and was its youngest winner.[384] In his career, 
            Bryant scored 40-plus points in 121 games, and 21 times he recorded a triple-double.</p><br>
            
            <p>Following his death, on February 15, 2020, commissioner Adam Silver announced that the NBA All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed 
            to the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP Award in honor of Bryant.</p><br>
