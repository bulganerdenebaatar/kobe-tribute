            <h2>Personal life</h2>
            <p>Bryant was the youngest of three children. He grew up with two older sisters, Sharia and Shaya, and had a close relationship with
            them until his death.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In November 1999, 21-year-old Bryant met 17-year-old Vanessa Laine while she was working as a background dancer on the
            Tha Eastsidaz music video "G'd Up". Bryant was in the building and working on his debut album. The two began dating and 
            became engaged six months later in May 2000, while Laine was still a senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California. 
            To avoid media scrutiny, she finished high school through independent study. According to Vanessa's cousin Laila Laine, 
            there was no prenuptial agreement. Vanessa said Bryant "loved her too much for one".</p>
            <br/>
            <p>They married on April 18, 2001, at St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Dana Point, California. 
            The wedding was not attended by Bryant's parents, his two sisters, his longtime advisor and agent Arn Tellem, 
            or his Laker teammates. Bryant's parents were opposed to the marriage for a number of reasons. 
            Reportedly Bryant's parents had problems with him marrying so young, especially to a woman who was not African-American.
            This disagreement resulted in an estrangement period of over two years, which ended when the couple's first daughter was born.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The Bryants' first child was born in January 2003. The birth resulted in a reconciliation between Bryant and his parents. 
            Due to an ectopic pregnancy, Vanessa suffered a miscarriage in the spring of 2005. Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore (also referred to as "Gigi"), 
            was born in May 2006. On December 16, 2011, Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, 
            and the couple requested joint custody of their daughters. On January 11, 2013, Bryant and his wife both announced via social media that 
            they had called off their divorce. In early December 2016, Vanessa gave birth to their third daughter, and in January 2019 the Bryants announced they were expecting a 
            fourth daughter. Their daughter was born in June 2019.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Bryant was a practicing Catholic. He said his faith and a priest helped him through difficult times, 
            such as the period following his accusation of rape. A Catholic cantor said she was inspired by Bryant's faith, 
            and the respect that he showed her. Bryant and his family were regular attendees at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church in Newport Beach. 
            Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, received the Eucharist together just hours before they died.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Bryant was multilingual. He was fluent in English, Italian and Spanish. Bryant assigned himself the nickname of "Black Mamba", 
            citing a desire for his basketball skills to mimic the eponymous snake's ability to "strike with 99% accuracy at maximum speed, 
            in rapid succession." During the 2012–13 season, he began referring to himself as "vino" to describe how his play had been aging like a fine wine.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In January 2002, Bryant bought a Mediterranean-style house for $4 million, located on a cul-de-sac in Newport Coast, Newport Beach. 
            He sold the house in May 2015.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 2013, Bryant had a legal disagreement with an auction house over memorabilia from his early years that his mother had put up for auction. 
            Bryant's mother received $450,000 from the auction house for the items, and contended Bryant had given her the rights to the items he had remaining in her home. 
            However, Bryant's lawyers asked the auction house to return the items. Before the scheduled trial, a settlement was reached allowing 
            the auction house the sale of less than 10% of the items. Bryant's parents apologized to him for the misunderstanding in a written statement, 
            and appreciated the financial support he had given them over the years.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Bryant was a lifelong fan of his hometown NFL team, the Philadelphia Eagles. He was also a fan of soccer teams Barcelona, AC Milan and Manchester City.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>According to Forbes, Bryant's $680 million in career earnings was the most ever by a team athlete during their playing career.</p>
            <br/>

            <h2>Endorsements</h2>

            <p>Before starting the 1996–97 season, Bryant signed a six-year contract with Adidas that was worth approximately $48 million.
            His first signature shoe was the Equipment KB 8. Bryant's other, earlier endorsements included deals with The Coca-Cola Company 
            to endorse their Sprite soft drink, appearing in advertisements for McDonald's, promoting Spalding's new NBA Infusion Ball, 
            Upper Deck, Italian chocolate company Ferrero SpA's brand Nutella, Russell Corporation,and appearing on his own series of 
            video games by Nintendo. Many companies like McDonald's and Ferrero SpA terminated his contracts when rape allegations against him 
            became public. A notable exception was Nike, Inc., who had signed him to a five-year, $40–45 million contract just before the 
            incident. However, they refused to use his image or market a new shoe of his for the year but eventually did start promoting 
            Bryant once his image recovered two years later. He has since resumed endorsement deals with The Coca-Cola Company, 
            through their subsidiary Energy Brands, to promote their Vitamin Water brand of drinks. Bryant was also the cover athlete for NBA '07: Featuring 
            the Life Vol. 2 and appeared in commercials for the video games Guitar Hero World Tour (with Tony Hawk, Michael Phelps, and Alex Rodriguez) 
            in 2008 and Call of Duty: Black Ops (alongside Jimmy Kimmel) in 2010.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In a 2008 video promoting Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant appears to jump over a speeding Aston Martin. 
            The stunt was considered to be fake, and the Los Angeles Times said a real stunt would probably be a violation of 
            Bryant's Lakers contract. After promoting Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant came out with the fourth edition of his signature line by
            Nike, the Zoom Kobe IV. In 2010 Nike launched another shoe, Nike Zoom Kobe V. In 2009, Bryant signed a deal with Nubeo to market 
            the "Black Mamba collection", a line of sports/luxury watches that range from $25,000 to $285,000. On February 9, 2009, Bryant was featured on 
            the cover of ESPN The Magazine. However, it was not for anything basketball related; rather, it was about Bryant being a big fan of FC Barcelona.
            CNN estimated Bryant's endorsement deals in 2007 to be worth $16 million a year. In 2010, Bryant was ranked third behind Tiger Woods and Jordan in Forbes' list 
            of the world's highest-paid athletes with $48 million.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>On December 13, 2010, Bryant signed a two-year endorsement deal with Turkey's national airline, Turkish Airlines. 
            The deal involved Bryant being in a promotional film to be aired in over 80 countries in addition to his being used in digital, 
            print and billboard advertising.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In September 2012, Bryant shot a commercial for Turkish Airlines with FC Barcelona star Lionel Messi. 
            In the airline's latest commercial, the duo competes to win the attention of a young boy.
            In 2013, Forbes listed Bryant the fifth highest paid sports star in the world behind Floyd Mayweather, Cristiano Ronaldo, 
            LeBron James and Lionel Messi.</p>
            <br/>
            </div>

            <div class="col column">
            <h2><Music></h2>
                <p>In high school, Bryant was a member of a rap group called CHEIZAW, named after the Chi Sah gang in the martial arts film Kid 
            with the Golden Arm. The group was signed by Sony Entertainment, but the company's ultimate goal was to eliminate the group
            and have Bryant record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant's youth and NBA fame. 
            He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway & King Tech and recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight's "Hold Me". 
            Bryant even appeared on Lakers teammate O'Neal's Respect, starting the track "3 X's Dope", though Bryant's name was not listed
            on the credits.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of underground hip hop into a more radio-friendly sound. 
            His debut album, Visions, was scheduled to release in the spring of 2000. The first single, "K.O.B.E'", featured supermodel Tyra Banks 
            singing the hook. The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song was not 
            well received. Sony abandoned plans for the album, which was never released, and dropped Bryant later that year. 
            The Sony president who originally signed Bryant had already left, and Bryant's other backers had mostly abandoned him. 
            Afterward, Bryant co-founded an independent record label, Heads High Entertainment, but it folded within a year.
            In 1999, Bryant appeared on a remix of "Say My Name" by Destiny's Child on the Maxi single version of the song.</p>

            <br/>

            <p>In 2011, Bryant was featured in Taiwanese singer Jay Chou's single, "The Heaven and Earth Challenge" (天地一鬥, pronounced "Tian Di Yi Dou").
            The proceeds for downloads of both the single and ringtones were donated to impoverished schools for basketball facilities and equipment.
            The music video of the single also features Bryant. The song was also used by Sprite in its 2011 marketing campaign in China.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 2009, rapper Lil Wayne titled a song "Kobe Bryant". Similarly, in 2010, rapper Sho Baraka released a song called "Kobe Bryant On'em", 
            which was featured on his album Lions and Liars.</p>

            <div class="col column">
            <h2>Television</h2>
            <p>Bryant made his acting debut in 1996, appearing in an episode of Moesha. He had met the show's star, Brandy, earlier in the year at a Nike All-Star basketball game,
            and then a couple of months later in May 1996, Brandy was Bryant's date to his high school senior prom. 
            In 1998, he portrayed himself on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series All That, and then appeared on MTV's Ridiculousness in 2019.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Beginning in 2018, Bryant wrote, produced and hosted a multi-season television series called ‘Detail’ which aired on ESPN and 
            ESPN+. It featured Bryant's insights into the game of basketball and in-depth analyses of games and individual players.</p><br/>
            </div>

            <div class="col column">
            <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
            <p>Bryant was the official ambassador for After-School All-Stars (ASAS), an American non-profit organization that provides comprehensive 
            after-school programs to children in thirteen US cities. Bryant also started the Kobe Bryant China Fund which partnered with the 
            Soong Ching Ling Foundation, a charity backed by the Chinese government. The Kobe Bryant China Fund raises money within China earmarked 
            for education and health programs. On November 4, 2010, Bryant appeared alongside Zach Braff at the Call of Duty: Black Ops launch event 
            at the Santa Monica Airport, where they presented a $1 million check to the Call of Duty Endowment, an Activision-founded nonprofit 
            organization that helps veterans transition to civilian careers after their military service has ended.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Together with his wife, Bryant founded the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation (KVBFF). Its goals are "helping young people in need, 
            encouraging the development of physical and social skills through sports and assisting the homeless". 
            Bryant spoke of the injustice aimed at homeless people who are blamed for their situation, saying that homelessness should not be ignored 
            or made a low priority. Bryant said he wanted more out of life than just a successful basketball career.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Bryant was a founding donor of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. During his lifetime, Bryant granted over two hundred 
            requests for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><br/>
            </div>

            <div class="col column">
            <h2>Business ventures</h2>
            <p>Bryant established Kobe Inc. to own and grow brands in the sports industry. The initial investment was a 10% stake in the Bodyarmor SuperDrink company 
            for $6 million in March 2014. The headquarters are in Newport Beach, California. With The Coca-Cola Company purchasing a minority stake in the 
            company in August 2018, the valuation of Bryant's stake rose to approximately $200 million.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 2013, Bryant launched a production company called Granity Studios, which developed different media, ranging from films, to television shows, 
            to novels.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>On August 22, 2016, Bryant and his business partner Jeff Stibel launched Bryant-Stibel, a venture capital firm focused on different businesses including 
            media, data, gaming, and technology, with $100 million in funding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col column">
            <h2>Film</h2>
            <p>Bryant was the subject of Spike Lee's 2009 documentary film Kobe Doin' Work, which chronicled Bryant during the 2007-08 NBA season.

            <br/>
            <p>In 2018, Bryant became the first African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and the first former professional athlete 
            to be nominated and to win an Academy Award in any category for his film Dear Basketball. The film also won the Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject 
            and a Sports Emmy Award. The film was produced by Bryant's production company, Granity Studios. In addition to future animation projects, 
            he had been in talks with animator veteran Bruce Smith for the last six months before his death about starting his own animation studio.</p>

            <div class="col column">
            <h2>Books</h2>
            <p>On October 23, 2018, Bryant's book The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, with photographs and afterword by Andrew D. Bernstein, 
            an introduction by Phil Jackson, and a foreword by Pau Gasol, was published by MCD / Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 
            The book looks back on his career with photos and his reflections.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>At the time of his death, he was working with Brazilian author Paulo Coelho on a children's book aimed at inspiring underprivileged children. 
            After Bryant's death, Coelho deleted the draft, saying in an interview that "it didn't make any sense to publish without him." 
            He did not say how many pages had been written or whether the book had a title.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Bryant also co-wrote/produced several young adult novels through Granity Studios: The Wizenard Series: Training Camp, Legacy and the Queen, and Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof. 
            A fourth novel, The Wizenard Series: Season One, will be released posthumously in March 2020.</p>

            <h2>Death</h2>

            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Accident</h4>
            <p>At 9:06 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, with nine people aboard: Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, six family friends, and the pilot. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California Secretary of State business database. The group was traveling to Camarillo Airport in Ventura County for a basketball game at Bryant's Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Due to light rain and fog that morning, the Los Angeles Police Department helicopters and most other air traffic were grounded.[491] The flight tracker showed that the helicopter circled above the L.A. Zoo due to heavy air traffic in the area. At 9:30 a.m. the pilot contacted the Burbank Airport's control tower, notifying the tower of the situation and was told he was "flying too low" to be tracked by radar. At that time, the helicopter experienced extreme fog and turned south towards the mountains. At 9:40 a.m. the helicopter climbed rapidly from 1,200 to 2,000 feet (370 to 610 m), flying at 161 knots (298 km/h; 185 mph).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>At 9:45 a.m., the helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain in Calabasas, about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and began burning. Bryant, his daughter, and the other seven occupants were killed. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter crashed in the hills above Calabasas in heavy fog. Witnesses reported hearing a helicopter struggling before crashing.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Investigations</h4>
            <p>The cause of the crash is still unknown, as the helicopter was not equipped with a black box. The Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, and the FBI[488] have launched investigations into the crash. On January 28, Bryant's identity was officially confirmed using fingerprints. The following day, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner stated that the official cause of death for him and the eight others on the helicopter was blunt force trauma.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Tributes and funeral services</h4>
            <p>On February 7, Bryant and his daughter were buried in a private funeral in Pacific View Memorial Park in the Corona del Mar neighborhood of Newport Beach, California. Their graves were unmarked to protect their privacy. A public memorial service was held on February 24 (2/24, marking both Kobe's and Gianna's numbers) at Staples Center with Jimmy Kimmel hosting.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The NBA had postponed the Lakers' game against the Clippers just two days after the accident on January 28 – the first time an NBA game had been postponed for any reason since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing led to the postponement of a Celtics game. On January 30, the first game after the crash was played at Staples Center between the Clippers and the Kings, the Clippers honored Bryant before the game, with Southern California native Paul George narrating a video tribute to Bryant. The next day, the Lakers played their first game after the crash against the Trail Blazers.
            Ahead of the match, the Lakers paid tribute to Bryant and all who lost their lives in the crash with a ceremony held just before tip off, with Usher singing "Amazing Grace" and Boyz II Men singing the National Anthem, while Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth reunited to perform "See You Again" – originally their tribute to Paul Walker after his death while filming Furious 7 – at halftime. 
            James also delivered a speech to the crowd before the game, and every starter in the Lakers starting lineup was announced with Bryant's name. The game was the second-most watched game in ESPN history, averaging 4.41 million viewers.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Also, on the day of the crash, beginning with the Spurs and the Raptors in their game in San Antonio, teams paid tribute to Bryant at the start of their games with intentional on-court violations referring to his uniform numbers on their first possession – either violations of the 24-second shot clock or the rule requiring teams to advance the ball past midcourt within eight seconds. On February 15, NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed to the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player in Bryant's honor.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Elsewhere, the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards went ahead as scheduled at the Staples Center on the day of the crash, but included tributes by multiple artists and groups, including host Alicia Keys opening the show with a tribute speech and joining Boyz II Men to sing "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday".</p>
