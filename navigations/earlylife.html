    <p>Bryant was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of three children and only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. 
        He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, 
        which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean." 
        Bryant's family was Catholic and he had always practiced his faith.</p>

        <p>Bryant started playing basketball when he was aged three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. 
        When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball 
        at a lower level. After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became 
        accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which he considered a 
        loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made. Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in 
        Reggio Emilia. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study. Another source of inspiration was 
        animated European films about sports, from which he learned more about basketball. He also learned to play soccer and his favorite 
        soccer team was A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league.
        When Bryant was thirteen, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cywynd Middle School.</p>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;">High School</h3>

    <p>Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in 
    the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first 
    freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record. The following 
    three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. During his junior year, 
    he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year 
    while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination, attracting attention from college recruiters in the process.
    Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list. However, after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the
    first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros.</p><br>

    <p>At Adidas ABCD Camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom. 
    While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, 
    where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse. In his senior year of high school, Bryant led the Aces to their 
    first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots
    in leading the Aces to a 31–3 record. Bryant ended his high school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time leading scorer 
    at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons.</p><br>

    <p>Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. These included being 
    named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, 
    a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today All-USA First Team player. Bryant's varsity coach, Greg Downer, 
    commented that he was "a complete player who dominates" and praised his work ethic, even as the team's top player.
    In 1996, Bryant took R&B singer Brandy to his senior prom. Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant made the decision to go directly 
    into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so. Bryant's news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when 
    prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common (Garnett being the only exception in 20 years). His basketball skills and 
    SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college he chose, but he did not officially visit any campuses.
    In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.</p><br>
